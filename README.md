My Static Website,

Hello There !!! ðŸ‘‹

I'm excited to share this simple static website that I built using only HTML and CSS. It's a small project that helped me practice layout design, styling, and creating a responsive website. The site includes various sections, which showcases different features like home cleaning, office cleaning, and more.
